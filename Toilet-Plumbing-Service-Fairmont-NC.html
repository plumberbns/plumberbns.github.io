<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is necessary to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be impractical in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
