If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you should require to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
