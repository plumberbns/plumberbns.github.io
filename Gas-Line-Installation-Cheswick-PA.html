I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

Feminine hygiene items should be gotten rid of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water originating from your water appliances? This is an excellent indicator that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced. Remember that if the rust-colored water only features warm water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
