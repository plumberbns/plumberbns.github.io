<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, examine the instructions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
