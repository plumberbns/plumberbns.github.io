<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Logan OH</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
