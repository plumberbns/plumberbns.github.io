Waste disposal unit guarantees last an average of 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Considering that the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to buy an extended service warranty. Most service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures.
