<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<p>Bonney's specialist plumbers can quickly retrofit your sink and install a new instant hot water heater along with a stylish immediate hot water faucet to match your kitchen decoration. Numerous hot water heater producers advise that you flush your hot water heater a minimum of as soon as a year to reduce the build-up of minerals. If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
