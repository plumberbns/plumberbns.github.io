The typical usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubricated to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. The use of too much lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out sooner by drawing in dirt and particles or restricting the movement of the component.
