A repair service will help identify whether this is the case.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
