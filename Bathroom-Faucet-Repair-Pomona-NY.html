<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

For the more severe clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Wingate plumber.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
