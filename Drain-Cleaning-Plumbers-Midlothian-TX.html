<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
