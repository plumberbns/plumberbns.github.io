<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and turn on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a close-by hot water faucet till you hear the gas burner in the hot water heater spark. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the issue.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
