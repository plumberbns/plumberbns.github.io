Copper has actually been used (in addition to PVC pipes) given that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is particularly beneficial for cold and hot tap water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>

While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.
