Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to from another location line the area of the pipe that is broken without having to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned up and dried, the installers will use the lining to the problem area. The liner is cured in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the cracks inside the pipe.</p>
<p>The cost depends on the size of the house and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing fixtures-- laundry room, damp bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to gain access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your last costs.
