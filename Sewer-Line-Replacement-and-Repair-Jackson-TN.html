<p>There are 2 popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt install (if you've had a disposer set up for some time, it's probably installed by doing this) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the very same task with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount system is meant to be much easier to deal with when fixing an unit or installing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
