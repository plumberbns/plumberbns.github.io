<p>Look for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole.
