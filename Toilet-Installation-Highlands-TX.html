Not just can unclean pipes cause your water to drain slowly, however it can also cause pipes to burst and sewage-disposal tank back-ups. Guarantee you do not have a plumbing disaster and make sure your pipes are clean. Check water or air test on system. Air Test: 5 psi or Water Test: 10 foot head of pressure. The test will hold for a minimum of 15 minutes without leakages. 2. DO throw a few lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it function properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.</p>

Handling fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

It's important to know how to preserve and care for your all your home's plumbing components and systems to keep things running efficiently.</p>
