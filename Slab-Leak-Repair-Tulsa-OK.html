<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Tulsa OK?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
