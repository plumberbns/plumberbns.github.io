<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is necessary to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in lots of circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
