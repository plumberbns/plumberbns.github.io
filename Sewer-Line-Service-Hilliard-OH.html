Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>While the expenses to repipe a house differs with each job and across the United States, it will generally cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single feature (toilet, tub, etc.) and you can anticipate to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a complete piping system replacement. More extreme cross-connection dangers might need a special kind of backflow preventer that can automatically release potentially polluted water prior to it gets in the public supply of water.
