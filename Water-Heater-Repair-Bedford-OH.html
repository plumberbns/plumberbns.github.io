<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Bedford OH</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater. To guarantee that we are supplying top quality work and consumer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to standard hot water heater, we likewise install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
