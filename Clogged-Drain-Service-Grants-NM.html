<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
