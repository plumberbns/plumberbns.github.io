It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.

And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
