Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.)

For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Since pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
