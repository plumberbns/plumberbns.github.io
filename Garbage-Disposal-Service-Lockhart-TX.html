<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, difficult water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
