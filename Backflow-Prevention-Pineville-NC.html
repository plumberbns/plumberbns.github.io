<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange below the sink. Press it into location, and loosely protect it by turning the lower installing ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper mounting ring. Turn disposer system as required to line up drain assembly. There's a nasty smell originating from your drains - You may not see this immediately, but nasty odors suggest whatever is stuck in your drains-- most likely food waste-- is decomposing in there. If you can smell it, it's time to unclog.</p>
