<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Once again, it is recommended to examine the manufacturer's guidelines for unique safety measures.</p>
