<p>Eliminate the locknut that holds the toilet valve to the tank. Lower carefully on the valve as you loosen the nut. Take out the old valve. Replacing the water pipes in your home is essential for maintaining a healthy operating water system and a general optimum home plumbing system. Low water pressure and pipes constructed out of galvanized steel lead to higher levels of rust and deterioration. These events also adversely affect your home's plumbing and can lead to greater problems that can be prevented with the suitable pipe replacement.</p>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
