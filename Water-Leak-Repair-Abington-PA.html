<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
