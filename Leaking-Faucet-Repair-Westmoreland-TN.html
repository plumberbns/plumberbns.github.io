<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might extremely well become part of your project requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
