Setting up a new gas line in the kitchen will normally vary from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're transforming your home to gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. New gas line costs include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>

Sewer cams can go hundreds of feet into the pipe, so they can be used to scope the main line. The camera will send out a signal when it discovers the clog, telling the inspector the specific location.
