<p>Leaking sewer lines inside your house can damage floorings, woodworking, and other important things such as cabinets.

The installing assembly parts are a bit various between the two installing systems, however the procedure is largely the very same.</p>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
