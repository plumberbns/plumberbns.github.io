<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Carrboro NC</h3>
<p>If you are upgrading your gas devices, you should update the piping as well. Gas leakages can be unsafe and scary. We're here for you every action of the method. Call (866) 701-5306 to set up an appointment. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional usage, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
