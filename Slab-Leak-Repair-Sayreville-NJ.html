<p>It is important that you attend to any and all problems that you discover in the house's plumbing system (or in other places in the home, for that matter) with the seller or real estate agent prior to making an offer or closing the sale. While many houses featured a home warranty that will cover the various systems within the home for a specific time period, you can still be out of pocket if the plumbing system is in disrepair and your house becomes harmed as an outcome. In many circumstances, you will discover that repairs that need to be made will be made in order to get the house off the market. If you are a bit useful and have the time to do repair work yourself, you can also utilize the results from your house plumbing inspection to negotiate a lower price on the house to accommodate for the materials and labor associated with remedying any issue points.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
