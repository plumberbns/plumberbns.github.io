This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that will not stay with any surface area in your home, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters free of tough water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners due to the fact that they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.
