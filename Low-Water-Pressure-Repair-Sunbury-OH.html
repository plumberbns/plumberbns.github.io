<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
