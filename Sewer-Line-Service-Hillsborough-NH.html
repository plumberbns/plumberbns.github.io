<p>Our team at All Stage Plumbing also uses drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is totally saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. The liner is left to solidify in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be gotten rid of and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
