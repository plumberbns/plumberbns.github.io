<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Although the specialist agreed that the client did the best thing in her efforts to tighten the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had actually ended up being incredibly worn away for many years and that a PVC pipe might be much better suited for the customer's requirements. He shut off the supply of water to the home, eliminated the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the house, the specialist brought back water circulation and tested the pipe.</p>
