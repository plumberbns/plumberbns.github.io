<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A clogged toilet can be one of the most frustrating problems in your house. Our Albuquerque plumbers can unclog your toilet and offer you options for preventing future problems. If your toilet is difficult to flush since you need to flush it several times, it may be the result of bad drain ventilation or a clog somewhere farther down the line. We could install a vacuum tank toilet that uses vacuum pressure to help gravity to guarantee that the whole contents of the bowl are flushed.</p>
