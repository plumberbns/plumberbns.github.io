<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the watering system.
