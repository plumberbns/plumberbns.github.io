<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>

As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
