<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<p>Look for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
