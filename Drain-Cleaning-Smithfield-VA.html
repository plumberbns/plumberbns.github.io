<p>Provide us a call today at (801) 726-3329 or contact us online to request waste disposal unit services along the Wasatch Front. Do not create a connection in between an auxiliary water supply (well, tank, body of water) and the water system plumbing.

Garbage disposal warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can vary between 2 and ten years. Because the typical life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may wish to acquire a prolonged warranty. Most service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To prevent additional malfunctions, house owners should stay up to date with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
