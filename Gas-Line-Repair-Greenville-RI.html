<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
