<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed.

The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
