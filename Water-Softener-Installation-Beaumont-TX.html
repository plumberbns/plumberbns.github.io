<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
