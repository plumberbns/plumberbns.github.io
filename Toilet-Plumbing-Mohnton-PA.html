I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
