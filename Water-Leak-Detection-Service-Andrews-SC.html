<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply.
