<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
