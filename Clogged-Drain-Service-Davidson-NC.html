Make sure to run it often to keep it clear and always run water prior to and after utilizing it, in addition to during for continuous feeds.

The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be irritating.
