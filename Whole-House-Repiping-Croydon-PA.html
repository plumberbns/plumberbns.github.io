Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ years of age hot water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are unsure how old your system is, you need to be able to get that information from the serial number on the maker's sticker label (normally near the top of the unit). Generally, the first 2 numbers indicate the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>The term difficult water" might seem like an oxymoron, however it's simply household water that contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to consume. They also are relatively undetectable through smell or taste, but they can be hazardous just the very same. Just like our trenchless services, we will initially conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners found in house supply and hardware stores will eliminate almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water throughout the softening process. Softeners also will eliminate approximately 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (higher than 10 ppm) may need pretreatment to prolong the life expectancy of a water softener. The effects of a malfunctioning toilet differ greatly-- from the mild inconvenience of a tank that won't stop running to the potentially devastating and unsanitary back-up of unflushed sewage.
