<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested every year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
