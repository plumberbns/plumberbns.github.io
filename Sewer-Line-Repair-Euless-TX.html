Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked annually to insure the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
