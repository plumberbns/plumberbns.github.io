<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
