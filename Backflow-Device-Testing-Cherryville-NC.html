Clogged drains can quickly become significant issues if not handled correctly. Call us today at (303) 758-6237 for fast, accurate service in Denver and the surrounding areas. We've already seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them? When it comes to the issue of difficult water, a traditional water softener really eliminates calcium, magnesium and silica ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called momentary solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in difficult water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some appliances. Water softening is normally accomplished utilizing ion-exchange resins. The garbage disposal is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the tip of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap until you break loose the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
