Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
