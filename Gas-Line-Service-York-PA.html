Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as five years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
