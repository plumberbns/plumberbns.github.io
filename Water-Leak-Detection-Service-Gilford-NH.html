Understanding if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be useful when working out the sale of a house. There are many types of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get a whole house plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>All faucets and valves in your home should be regularly exercised to keep them from freezing in location.

<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Double Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a disrobed Double Check Valve without shut down valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are typically utilized by water companies and installed after a water meter to avoid the meter from running in reverse and low security versus backflow. This piece of equipment is the center of debate with numerous backflow authorities and must never be puzzled with Double Check Valves. Check with local authorities for required installation, as a lot of do not recognize these as backflow prevention gadgets.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Once again, it is a good idea to inspect the producer's guidelines for special preventative measures.</p>
