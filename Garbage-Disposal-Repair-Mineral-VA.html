<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your house, then that normally implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple areas and any mix of drains.

<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right away and sometimes those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be appropriately re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
