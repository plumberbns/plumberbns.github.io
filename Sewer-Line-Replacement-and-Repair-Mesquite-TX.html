Well, first let's ask you a various question: How old is your house? If it was built prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an outdated product that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not already). And if your home was constructed before The second world war, then it likely needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the issue.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
