<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover impurities.</p>

It is estimated that a typical household can conserve as much as $100 each year by changing to the tankless heater.</p>
