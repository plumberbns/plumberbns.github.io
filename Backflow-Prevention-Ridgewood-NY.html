<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>

And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically designed to be utilized with a septic tank. gives an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
