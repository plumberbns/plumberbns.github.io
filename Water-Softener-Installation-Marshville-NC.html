<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
