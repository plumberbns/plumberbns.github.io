<p>The term difficult water refers to water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the nation you're in, but most commonly include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Tough water does not start hard-- rather, it picks up mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>Reducing or eliminating water solidity is finished with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure happens. A softener is comprised of different parts, each having their own distinct purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel normally constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a routine schedule.</p>
