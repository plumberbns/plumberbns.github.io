<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You may need to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
