<p>Improperly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job.

Jay B and Aaron scoped the job quickly and discussed the strategy for diagnosis and repair. They kept me informed and stood firm through really difficult sewer line cleanup and repair. I will advise SW plumbing for any significant repair.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has already been fouled. Again, it is advisable to inspect the manufacturer's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
