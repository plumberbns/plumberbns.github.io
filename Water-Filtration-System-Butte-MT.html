<p>Lubrication might assist with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the service technician assemble the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lube to ensure the water supply is not infected. In a lot of cases the very best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubricated to assure they do not roll out of their retainer.

Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are readily available. However they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
