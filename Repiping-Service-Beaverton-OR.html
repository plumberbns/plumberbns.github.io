So it's a. great time to think about getting a brand name new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
