<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, however I give the company props for contacting us to upgrade us on the later arrival time. Some jobs take longer than expected, that's easy to understand, by keeping us informed of the minor delay, we didn't need to stress.</p>
