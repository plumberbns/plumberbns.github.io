<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we reveal, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
