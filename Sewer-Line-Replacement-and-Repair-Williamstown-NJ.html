In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any remaining contaminants.</p>
