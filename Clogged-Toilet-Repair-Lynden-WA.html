<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your day-to-day routine. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing team will initially cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and particles. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and then remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building material as possible undamaged.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and select a patching task rather of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, reach you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
