<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
