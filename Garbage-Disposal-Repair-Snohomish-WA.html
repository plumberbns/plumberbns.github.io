<p>To assist avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the method set out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true.

Short-term water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.
